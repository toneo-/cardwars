# Card Wars

Card Wars is a gamemode for Garry's Mod based upon the **oc_cardwar** map available in the Obsidian Conflict source mod.

## What is it?
Card Wars is played with two teams, each of which may play four cards per battle.\
Each card represents one or more NPCs. One card is dealt to each team at the end of each battle with an extra card being dealt to the winner.

Some examples of cards are:
  - Zombies
  - Combine Soldiers
  - Alyx/Barney (the rare 'Hero' cards, which regenerate health!)

Cards can be played multiple times.

## Current State
Unplayable.

## In the future...
A list of things that need adding:
  - Cards, NPCs
  - Dedicated map
  - Gamemode itself

Some things that could be added to improve on the original **oc_cardwar**:
  - Giving vague orders to specific cards e.g. "stay back", "be super aggressive"
  - Positioning cards on the battlefield
  - More cards ... ?
